# This week we will work with loops. For this weekâ€™s assignment, write a program that uses a while loop to determine
# how long it takes for an investment to double at a given interest rate. The input will be an annualized interest
# rate and the initial investment amount and the output is the number of years it takes an investment to double.
# A=P(1+rt)
